# ferrao_bot

This is an implementation of go-telegram-bot-api in loving memory of a great friend that passed away. (RIP Vinícius Ferrão 1983-2017)

The goal is to emulate the presence of our late friend in Telegram groups.

The project is modular enough so with little effort is possible to adjust it to emulate any other person, based on their replies behaviour according to the discussed subject in each chat.

## Installation

Use the package manager to install ferrao_bot.

```bash
go get github.com:maulmota/ferrao_bot
```
